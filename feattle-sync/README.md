This crate is the implementation for some synchronization strategies for the feature flags
(called "feattles", for short).

The crate [`feattle_core`] provides the trait [`feattle_core::persist::Persist`] as the
extension point to implementors of the persistence layer logic. This crates has some useful
concrete implementations: [`Disk`] and [`S3`]. Please refer to the
[main package - `feattle`](https://crates.io/crates/feattle) for more information.

It also provides a simple way to poll the persistence layer for updates in [`BackgroundSync`].

## Optional features

- **aws_sdk_s3**: provides [`S3`] to integrate with AWS' S3 using the crate `aws-sdk-s3` crate
- **rusoto_s3**: provides [`RusotoS3`] to integrate with AWS' S3 using the crate `rusoto` crate
