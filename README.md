Featture toggles for Rust  (called "feattles", for short), extensible and with background
synchronization and administration UI.

### Features
- Feature toggles that synchronize automatically with a backing storage
- Feature toggles can be as simple `bool`, but can also be lists, maps and arbitrary tpes (
  (through the [`FeattleValue`] trait).
- Web UI with documentation, change history, validation
- JSON API to read and set the toggles
- Modular and extensible: use as much or as little of the bundled features as you want. Want to
  use a different Web UI? A different storage layer? No problem.

### Example

```rust
use rusoto_s3::S3Client;
use rusoto_core::Region;
use feattle::*;
use std::sync::Arc;

/// A struct with your feature toggles: you can use primitive types (like `bool`, `i32`, etc),
/// standard collections (like `Vec`, `BTreeSet`, etc) or any arbitrary type that implements
/// the required trait.
feattles! {
    struct MyFeattles {
        /// Is this usage considered cool?
        is_cool: bool = true,
        /// Limit the number of "blings" available.
        /// This will not change the number of "blengs", though!
        max_blings: i32,
        /// List the actions that should not be available
        blocked_actions: Vec<String>,
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Store their values and history in AWS' S3
    use std::time::Duration;
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let persistence = Arc::new(S3::new(
        &config,
        "my-bucket".to_owned(),
        "some/s3/prefix/".to_owned(),
    ));

    // Create a new instance
    let my_feattles = Arc::new(MyFeattles::new(persistence));

    // Poll the storage in the background
    BackgroundSync::new(&my_feattles).start().await;

    // Start the admin UI with `warp`
    let admin_panel = Arc::new(AdminPanel::new(my_feattles.clone(), "Project Panda - DEV".to_owned()));
    tokio::spawn(run_warp_server(admin_panel.clone(), ([127, 0, 0, 1], 3030)));

    // Or serve the admin panel with `axum`
    let router = axum_router(admin_panel);
    tokio::spawn(
        axum::Server::bind(&([127, 0, 0, 1], 3031).into()).serve(router.into_make_service()),
    );

    // Read values (note the use of `*`)
    assert_eq!(*my_feattles.is_cool(), true);
    assert_eq!(*my_feattles.max_blings(), 0);
    assert_eq!(*my_feattles.blocked_actions(), Vec::<String>::new());
}
```

You can run a full example locally with: `cargo run --example full --features='s3 uuid warp axum'`.

With this code, you'll get an Web Admin UI like:

![Home Web Admin UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sitegui/feattle-rs/master/imgs/home.png)

You can use the UI to edit the current values and see their change history. For example, this
is what you can expect when editing an `enum`:

![Edit enum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sitegui/feattle-rs/master/imgs/edit_enum.png)

It also supports complex types with a JSON editor and helpful error diagnostics:

## How it works

The macro will generate a struct with the given name and visibility modifier (assuming private
by default). The generated struct implements [`Feattles`] and also exposes one method for each
feattle.

The methods created for each feattle allow reading their current value. For example, for a
feattle `is_cool: bool`, there will be a method like
`pub fn is_cool(&self) -> MappedRwLockReadGuard<bool>`. Note the use of
[`parking_lot::MappedRwLockReadGuard`] because the interior of the struct is stored behind a `RwLock` to
control concurrent access.

A feattle is created with the syntax `$key: $type [= $default]`. You can use doc coments (
starting with `///`) to describe nicely what they do in your system. You can use any type that
implements [`FeattleValue`] and optionally provide a default. If not provided, the default
will be created with `Default::default()`.

## Minimum supported Rust version

As of this release, the MSRV is 1.60.0, as tested in the CI. A patch release will never require
a newer MSRV.

## Optional features

You can easily declare feattles with your custom types, use another persistance storage logic
or Web Framework (or any at all). For some out-of-the-box functionality, you can activate these
cargo features:

- **uuid**: will add support for [`uuid::Uuid`].
- **rusoto_s3**: provides [`RusotoS3`] to integrate with AWS' S3
- **aws_sdk_s3**: provides [`S3`] to integrate with AWS' S3
- **warp**: provides [`run_warp_server`] for a read-to-use integration with [`warp`]
- **axum**: provides [`axum_router`] for a read-to-use integration with [`axum`]

### Crate's organization

This crate is a simple re-export of these three components:

* `feattle-core`: [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/feattle-core.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/feattle-core)
* `feattle-sync`: [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/feattle-sync.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/feattle-sync)
* `feattle-ui`: [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/feattle-ui.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/feattle-ui)

Having them separate allows for leaner lower-level integration. If you're creating a crate to
provide a different storage or admin, you just need `feattle-core`.
